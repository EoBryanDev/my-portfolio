# My Webdeveloper Portfolio

Hello ! I'm Bryan, a brazilian developer.
To see the whole project build check out on: (<http://https://mb-inc-portfolio.netlify.app/>)

## Summary

My project was splitted in many parts for I could develop the project ideas clearly.
It was separated in:

* Requirements Analysis;
* Layout Design on Figma;
* Build Project Base and Install Main Dependencies;
* Build Components Following Mobile First Concept;
* Polish Layout to Tablet and Desktop sizes;
* Deploy Projects.

### `Requirements Analysis`

To guide my development process I built a Requirement File to me be able think in the big picture of the project. I separated in four Requirement categories:

#### Functional Requirement

Here I selected the project's main goals as well as links redirects to my whatsapp and social media and show my projects.

#### Non-Functional Requirement

This topic I choose tools to website's layout be more attractive to be seeing as well as dark mode, animated header, go to top,etc...

#### Business Requirement

Simplifying, I made clear what I've wanted with the project.

#### Design Requirement

Lastely, I selected and picked up all technologies that I wanted work with. Like work with ReactJS, ReactIcons,ESlint, Prettier,etc... There were some of them that I've not included in the first project version because it could be more complex that I needed.

### `Layout Design on Figma`

The project's second part was designing the prototype. To make it I choosed Figma. Throght this part I select color theme, font sizes, device sizes and typograph.

### `Build Project Base and Install Main Dependencies`

Before create the whole project I decided start installing dependencies that could be useful to developing process, as well as, editor code extensions as ESlint, Prettier, Babel and editorconfig.

### `Build Components Following Mobile First Concept`

Following global's tendency to use smartphone to access and navigate throught internet, I decided make the componentizing design think principally in smartphones. Thus my main thoght was keep the application interacting well with users. To do this I used go to top buttom, theme switcher, menu dropdown, pic carroulsels.

### `Polish Layout to Tablet and Desktop sizes`

Consummating the projects I just made a few adjustment to different display sizes, to tablet and desktop display.

### `Deploy Projects`

To project's deploy I used netlify to synchonizing with my github's repository.

## Further Versions Improvement

To other versions I plan to use other resources as well as Redux, Jest and create my own backend API to portfolio management.
